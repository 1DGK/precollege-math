# Pre-College Math
Many OSSU students choose to review math topics that they have not studied recently.
OSSU recommends to use a few resources for such a review: [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard/playlists) for lectures, [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) for textbooks, and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) for assesments.
After taking an assessment, you should have a clear idea of what topics to study and where you should start with the resources below.

When watching the lectures it is important that you pause before each question and work it out yourself, or try again after you understand the process.
After you complete a chapters worth of lectures, you should complete the [chapter review exercises](https://openstax.org/books/precalculus-2e/pages/1-review-exercises) found at the end of each chapter in your textbook.
Use your grade to determine what you need to review. OpenStax orders their review exercises by chapter section, allowing you to hone in on what you need to practice.
Practice what you have not mastered by:
1. Going to the proper section in your textbook and working on the examples as they have full answer explanations.
2. Rewatching Professor Leonard's video on the subject, working through the examples with him.
3. Searching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) for another POV on the topic, again working through the examples with them. [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@khanacademy) & [Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor) are great resources for this.
4. Doing the section exercises in your textbook.
5. Asking for help in the relevant [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/744385009028431943/744971809056751687).
